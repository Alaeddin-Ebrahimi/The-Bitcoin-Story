Features
Interactive Narrative: Guided exploration through Bitcoin's history, technology, market, and global impact.

Dynamic Market Data: Real-time display of Bitcoin's current price, market capitalization, and 24-hour trading volume fetched from a reliable API.

Historical Price Chart: An interactive line chart showing Bitcoin's price history (last 365 days) on a linear scale, with tooltips for specific data points.

Supply Mechanics Visualization: A clear donut chart illustrating Bitcoin's fixed supply cap and the proportion of mined vs. remaining coins.

Simplified Tech Explanations: Clickable cards for core concepts (Blockchain, Mining, Decentralization) revealing easy-to-understand analogies.

AI-Powered Insights (Gemini API):

"Ask Satoshi": Generates a philosophical quote from Satoshi Nakamoto's perspective.

"Explain it Better": Provides an even simpler, more concise analogy for technical concepts.

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.

Clear Source Attribution: Explicitly mentions data sources for dynamic and static content.

Error Handling: Includes basic retry mechanisms and informative messages for API data fetching failures.

Live Demo
To view a live preview of the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

(Note: For a true "live demo" link, you would typically deploy this project to a web hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc. and add the URL here.)

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser to run this application. No special server environment or backend setup is required, as all logic is client-side JavaScript.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-bitcoin-story.git

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username if this is a real repository.)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd the-bitcoin-story

Running the Application
Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

open index.html # On macOS
start index.html # On Windows
xdg-open index.html # On Linux (may vary)

The application will load in your browser, and market data will automatically begin fetching.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design. (Loaded via CDN)

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Core logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and API calls.

Chart.js: For creating dynamic and interactive charts (line chart, donut chart). (Loaded via CDN)

Chartjs Adapter Date-FNS: For date handling in Chart.js. (Loaded via CDN)

Google Gemini API: For AI-powered text generation ("Ask Satoshi" and "Explain it Better" features).

Note: An API key is automatically provided in the Gemini environment; if running outside, you would need to manage an API key securely.

Data Sources
The dynamic market data displayed in the "The Market" section (Current Price, Market Capitalization, 24-Hour Trading Volume, and Historical Price Chart) is fetched from the CoinGecko API.

The Bitcoin supply data (21 million cap, mined vs. remaining) is based on the Bitcoin Protocol itself, which is hardcoded into its design and universally agreed upon.
